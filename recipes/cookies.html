    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup brown sugar</li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
      </li>
      <br />
      <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup white sugar</li>
      <br />
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <br />
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <br />
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <br />
      <li>1 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <br />
      <li><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <br />
      <li>1 cup milk chocolate chips</li>
      <br />
      <li>1 (3 ounce) dark chocolate, cut into chunks</li>
      <br />
      <li>3 tablespoons white chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine brown sugar, butter, white sugar, and salt in a large bowl; beat
        with an electric mixer until a creamy, deep brown mixture forms. Add egg
        and vanilla; beat until mixture lightens and becomes smooth, 10 to 15
        seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix flour and baking soda together in a separate bowl. Add slowly to the
        wet ingredients until mostly incorporated, but some white traces of
        flour remain. Fold in milk chocolate, dark chocolate, and white
        chocolate using a spatula, not the mixer. Cover the dough and
        refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 48 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) when ready to bake.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide cold dough into 2 1/4-ounce portions and place on a cookie sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until the edges start to look golden brown
        and crispy, 10 to 12 minutes. Do not overbake; the centers will not look
        fully done. Cool until cookies are set, about 30 minutes.
      </li>
