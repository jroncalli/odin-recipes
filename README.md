# odin-recipes

My first project for theodinproject.

This will be a webpage with links to 3 other pages, each with it's own recipe.

Each recipe will have a picture of the finished dish, an unordered list of ingredients and an ordered list of the steps to make it.

I will also be practicing git commands while making this page.
